# HPML_Performances-of-Highly-Scalable-Deep-Learning-Training-System-with-Different-Precision
This is the project for 2022 Sprinf ECE-GY 9143 High Performance Machine Learnig, 
maintained by [Jingxuan Wang](https://github.com/Jexxie) and Yuchen Kou. 
We compare the performance of ResNet based on [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset under different precion situations.
